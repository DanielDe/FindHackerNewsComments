# Find Hacker News comments

This is a simple Chrome extension that finds HN comments for the page you're currently viewing. You can install it on [the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cnbppiehcbjecbpglbfnighalfamkfom/publish-accepted?authuser=0&hl=en-US).

It uses the [Hacker News index on Aloglia](https://hn.algolia.com/?query=&sort=byPopularity&prefix&page=0&dateRange=all&type=story) to perform the search. **The search isn't kicked off until you press the button in your menu bar**, so I'm not sending your full browsing history to Algolia.
